Renewable Energy

Introduction:

This report provides an analysis of renewable energy across various regions, utilizing Github as the platform for storing and sharing the information and also using Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, data validation, data analysis and also for the visualization. The report includes an overview of the renewable energy data, including total energy production and consumption, as well as a breakdown of renewable energy sources by region across different years. Additionally, the report includes visualizations of the data, such as maps and charts, to aid in understanding and interpreting the information. The report also shows the number of jobs opportunities created by the various energy sources and also the top countries for investment. Overall, this report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the renewable energy performance across different regions and help guide decision making for government, business and individuals.

The data analytics processes taken include the following,

- Ask Phase: This involves defining the problem to be solved and also to understand what is to be done or achieved.
- Prepare Phase: This is the phase where I collected the data and store the data for the upcoming analysis process.
- Process Phase: This involves finding and eliminating any errors and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results (Data Cleaning)
- Analyze Phase: Analyzing the data collected involves using tools to transform and organize that information so that I can draw a useful conclusions, make predictions and drive informed decision making.
- Share Phase: This involves interpretation of results and sharing them with others to help stakeholders make effective data driven decisions. This is achieved through Data Visualization. 

The steps taken to plan the data visualization include,

- I cleaned the data and removed all outliers using microsoft excel
- I also validated the data so as to check for the data accuracy and intergrity
- I explored the data for patterns
- I planned the visuals
- Then I created my visuals.
