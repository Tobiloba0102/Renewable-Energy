The data analytics processes taken include the following
- Ask Phase: This involves defining the problem to be solved and also to understand what is to be done or achieved.
- Prepare Phase: This is the phase where I collected the data and store the data for the upcoming analysis process.
- Process Phase: This involves finding and eliminating any errors and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results (Data Cleaning)
- Analyze Phase: Analyzing the data collected involves using tools to transform and organize that information so that I can draw a useful conclusions, make predictions and drive informed decision making.
- Share Phase: This involves interpretation of results and sharing them with others to help stakeholders make effective data driven decisions. This is achieved through Data Visualization. 

The steps taken to plan the data visualization include,
- I cleaned the data and removed all outliers using microsoft excel
- I also validated the data so as to check for the data accuracy and intergrity
- I explored the data for patterns
- I planned the visuals
- Then I created my visuals.
